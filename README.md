# socket-space
Spaceship Game with minimal multiplayer features (hopefully) and socket based server client communication

# TODO-Improvements
- Add config file/folder for port and stuff that both client and server use
- Switch to typescript setup, as that allows for accurate interface between client and server (see https://socket.io/docs/v4/typescript/)
