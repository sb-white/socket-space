# socket-space
Spaceship Game with minimal multiplayer features (hopefully) and socket based server client communication

# Server / Client start
After npm install start them with npx ts-node PATH from the socket-client/-server directory
- npx ts-node src/server.ts
- npx ts-node src/client.ts

# TODO-Improvements
- Add config file/folder for port and stuff that both client and server use
- ~Switch to typescript setup, as that allows for accurate interface between client and server ~(see https://socket.io/docs/v4/typescript/)
- Add scripts for easy server and client start
